# We are the UofT Think Tank, and our mission is to make the world a better place.
The Think Tank's Website: http://uoftthinktank.club/
<br><br>
Every week we bring together students from different academic backgrounds to discuss challenges being faced in their fields. From there we brainstorm ideas to solve the specific issues, and then implement our solutions.
<br><br>
Since software drives so much of today, it notoriously finds its way into our implementations. With the power and wide range software has, it can be the solution to many problems. That's why we focus on software solutions, and how they can better society.
<br><br>
The areas we get involved in range from humanities and social sciences, to engineering and computer science. Our club fosters diversity, and we believe there is no such thing as a stupid idea. Since we come from different fields, we learn a lot from each other while making a positive change in the world.
<br><br>
We have weeky meetings where we discuss ideas and design implementation. Please appy to stay in the loop.
